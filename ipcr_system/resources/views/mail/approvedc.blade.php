<p> Dear {{$ipcr_form['first_name']}} {{$ipcr_form['last_name']}}, </p>
<p>   </p>

<p> This is an automated message to tell you that your Division Chief has looked over your Individual Performance and Career Review (IPCR) form and given it the approval. </p>

<p> You should look over your current IPCR form and add the actual accomplishments that have happened. By doing this, you'll give your Division Chief a full picture of what you did and how you helped during the review time. </p>

<p> Please follow these steps to make any changes or additions to your IPCR form: </p>

<p> 1. Access the IPCR system or tool that we are using for the review. </p>
<p> 2. Find your IPCR form and choose "Edit" from the action menu. </p>
<p> 3. Put your real successes in the right areas or fields. </p>
<p> 4. Once you've made the changes you want, save the form. </p>
<p> Please remember that you have until {{$schedule['duration_to']}} to add these things to your IPCR form. After this date, the form will be final, and no more changes will be allowed. </p>

<p> We know how important it is to properly record your accomplishments, and we appreciate your help in this review process. Your feedback will be very helpful in making a full and accurate evaluation of your work. </p>

<p> If you need help or run into technical problems while changing your IPCR form, please don't hesitate to get in touch with me or the HR team. We're here to help you through every step of this. </p>

<p> Thank you for your hard work and commitment to your career growth. We can't wait to look at the latest version of your IPCR form, and we hope that your work keeps going well. </p>

<p> Best Regards, </p>
