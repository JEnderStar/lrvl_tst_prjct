<p> Dear {{$dc_info['first_name']}} {{$dc_info['last_name']}}, </p>
<p>   </p>

<p> This is a computerized message to let you know that {{$ipcr_form['first_name']}} {{$ipcr_form['last_name']}}'s Individual Performance and Career Review (IPCR) form grade has been rejected by the Director. </p>

<p> After a careful look, it was decided that the employee's score does not match up with what they have done and what they have contributed. It is important to make sure that the grade is a fair reflection of how well the employee did their job. </p>

<p> As the Division Chief, you are respected for your knowledge and understanding of how employees do their jobs and how well they do them. Your ideas and thoughts will be very helpful in making a full and fair review. </p>

<p> We'd appreciate it if you could look over {{$ipcr_form['first_name']}} {{$ipcr_form['last_name']}}'s IPCR form and let us know what grade you think is right. Your evaluation and suggestions will be a big part of making sure that the employee's evaluation is correct and matches up with what they've done and what was expected during the evaluation time. </p>

<p> Please don't be afraid to get in touch if you have any more questions or need more information. We really appreciate how quickly you have paid attention to this situation. </p>

<p> Thank you for working together and helping to make sure that the review process is fair. </p>
